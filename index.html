To that end, keep alert with all perseverance, making supplication for all the saints.</em></p>

        <p></br><strong>We Need to Protect Ourselves</strong></br>Spiritual warfare is a biblical reality described in the Bible from Genesis to Revelation where real entities make real war on believers.  Today there is a massive neglect of spiritual warfare training in the church and the church body has been suffering defeat.  Spiritual warfare will only increase as we approach the end of time.</p>
        <p>We have an enemy.  The scripture above describes rulers, authorities, cosmic powers of darkness, and spiritual forces of evil that are all arrayed against us in the unseen realm.  We need to learn how to protect ourselves against this enemy.  While this can be rather scary to contemplate, we also can be fully assured that we have everything we need to have complete protection against these dark forces.</p>
        <p>1 Peter 5:8 - <em>Be sober-minded; be watchful. Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour.</em></p>
        <p></br><strong>The Helmet of Salvation</strong></br>Salvation is your most important piece of armor.  Without it the other pieces of armor won't do you any good.  To have salvation you obviously need to have been <a href="https://severude.github.io/heaven">saved</a>.  This involves repentance and relying on Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior.</p>
        <p>Putting on the helmet of salvation involves remembering your identity in Christ and never forgetting the truth of what he has done for you.  The enemy will try to get you to  doubt your identity and will also try to make you doubt about whether or not you are actually saved.  Use the helmet of salvation to shape your perspective about who you are in Christ and never let the enemy create any doubts about your salvation.</p>
        <p>Romans 12:2 - <em>Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.</em></p>
        <p></br><strong>The Breastplate of Righteousness</strong></br>A breastplate is a piece of armor that protects our vital organs.  Whenever we chose to live in an unrighteous manner, we are removing our breastplate and are inviting demonic forces to assault us.  Having sin in our lives is like having an infected tooth.  If left unchecked, this tooth will make us very sick and it could even kill us.  You can't drink from the cup of the Lord and also from the cup of demons.</p>
        <p>If we have received salvation, then we have no business in living a sinful life.  We are made right before God only because Jesus died for our sin.  Our own righteousness is nothing but filthy rags.  Putting on the breastplate of righteousness involves putting to death our sin nature and totally depending on Christ's righteousness.</p>
        <p>Galatians 5:22-23 - <em>The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law.</em></p>
        <p></br><strong>The Belt of Truth</strong></br>The main weapon of the enemy is deception.  Eve was deceived by an enemy who challenged God's Word by asking "Did God really say this?".  It is important to learn the correct biblical worldview by being grounded in the Word of God.  Our truth and our reality need to be grounded in Jesus.  This is done by learning God's Word and also by learning the correct context of God's Word.  You can't put on the belt of truth if you are not living in truth.</p>
        <p>For example, many people have had their worldview shaped by what is called "science".  While science and the scientific method have created many advancements which have significantly increased our standard of living, science can't tell us where have we come from, where we are going, what is right and wrong, or even what is our purpose in life.  Anyone who is using science to tell you these things is like a fertilizer salesman.  Make sure you are using the Word of God to shape your worldview rather than from someone who is driving a tractor pulling a manure spreader.</p>
        <p>Colossians 2:8 - <em>See to it that no one takes you captive by philosophy and empty deceit, according to human tradition, according to the elemental spirits of the world, and not according to Christ.</em></p>
        <p></br><strong>The Boots of Peace</strong></br>The Hebrew word for peace is "shalom" which means completeness, soundness, welfare, and peace.  Shalom means that is it well with our soul.  This involves living in peace with ourselves and as much as possible, living in peace with our neighbors.  It involves reconciling with those who have wronged us as well as those we have wronged.  It does not mean rekindling any toxic relationships.</p>
        <p>The enemy will seek to rob you of your peace and to destroy your relationships with others.  It is important to let go of any long lasting grudges and any roots of bitterness.   Forgive others and have reconciliation with them as much as possible.  We must always be willing to show others the same grace that Christ has shown for us.</p>
        <p>Philippians 4:7 - <em>And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.</em></p>
        <p></br><strong>The Shield of Faith</strong></br>There will always be somewhere in life where the cards seem to be stacked against us.  The enemy will use these events as flaming arrows to create discouragement, anxiety, doubt, uncertainty, and disappointment which will make you feel helpless and paralyzed.  Faith gives us calmness in the midst of the all the darts of the evil one.</p>
        <p>The shield of faith involves focusing on God's faithfulness instead of our own immediate circumstances.  Trust that God is in control.  The Bible says that the righteous shall live by faith.  Use the shield of faith to deflect all of these projectiles and the days the enemy using you as a human pincushion are over.</p>
        <p>Psalms 28:7 - <em>The LORD is my strength and my shield; in him my heart trusts.</em></p>
        <p></br><strong>Stand and Stand Firm</strong></br>We are commanded to stand and to stand firm.  Be alert and persevere.  Be strong in the Lord and in the strength of His might.  The armor of God is received by faith and is manifested by obedience.  Biblical holiness is a must, the armor can't simply be prayed on.</p>
        <p>The devil roams around like a roaring lion looking for whomever he can devour.  Resist him and he will flee from you.  In this world we will have trouble, but take heart, Christ has overcome the world.  We have all the armor pieces we need to hold our ground against any schemes of the devil.</p>
        <p>Joshua 1:9 - <em>Be strong and courageous. Do not be frightened, and do not be dismayed, for the LORD your God is with you wherever you go.</em></p>
        <p></br><strong>The Sword of the Spirit</strong></br>The Word of God is an offensive weapon that will wreak havoc against the forces of the enemy.  Jesus demonstrated how to do this when he was tempted by the devil in the wilderness.  Every time when He was tempted by the enemy, Jesus correctly quoted the Word of God to defeat the enemy.  The enemy was ultimately defeated by what Jesus did at the cross and the Word of God has the power to destroy any schemes of the enemy.</p>
        <p>To use the Word of God, we obviously need to correctly know the Word of God and then to live out what the Word of God actually says.  The enemy also knows scripture very well, but he will always distort what scripture says, because lying is his nature.  We must always be on guard against being deceived.  When we correctly know and act out the Word of God, we can destroy any and all plans the enemy has made against our lives.</p>
        <p>Hebrews 4:12 - <em>The Word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and spirit, of joints and marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart.</em></p>
        <p></br><strong>Praying in the Spirit</strong></br>Intercession is the process of interceding on someone else's behalf.  Are you concerned about a family member, a friend, a coworker, an entertainer, a political leader, or anyone else you like or don't like.  Intercede and pray scripture over anyone or anything that comes to your mind.  Praying over people can change their lives and it also changes your life.  Always be thankful and never forget what a privilege it is to serve our Lord and King.</p>
        <p>Philippians 4:6 - <em>Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God.</em></p>
        <p></br><strong>Jesus is the Armor of God</strong></br>The armor of God is God's armor, not our armor.  Putting on the full armor of God involves putting on Jesus.  Jesus is our complete armor of God.  He alone is our salvation, our righteousness, our truth, our peace, our faith, and our spirit.  Nothing compares to the promise we have in Him.</p>
        <p>Use the strength of Jesus to protect yourself and to stand for what is right.  Use His might to fight for your family and your community.  Do you have your spiritual armor on?</p>
        <p>Romans 13:14 - <em>Put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to gratify its desires.</em></p>
